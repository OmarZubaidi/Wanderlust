## About the Project

A website that plans your entire trip for you and a companion mobile app.

You pick your dates and location; it suggests flights and accommodation to book beforehand and then plans your itinerary during the trip. You can also add your friends so you can all see who booked the same flights/hotels.

**Wanderlust** then gives you the points of interest and restaurants to visit (which you can rearrange to your heart's content). When it's time to travel, the companion app is your best friend. You'll have access to the calendar of the itinerary as well as a map showing all the locations. You'll also be able to see all flights and hotels you've booked. If you select something coming up in the calendar, it will give you directions to it.
